# racket-wiki-demo

A very simple demo about using Scribble to build a wiki.

## How to Use

``` 
raco pkg install https://github.com/yfzhe/racket-wiki-demo
```

Then the Racket package system will build the doc (wiki) for you. You can see that in your local doc after installation finished.

## TODO

- Custom raco command for add new wiki pages.
- Generate (some) pages like "Recent".
- How to implement "categories" or "tags"
